3n+1

The 3n + 1 problem
Your program will be given a positive number (less than 10,000). Your program will take the number and follow the appropriate step below:

when n is even, divide n by 2
when n is odd, multiply n by 3, and then add 1
When n is equal to one you stop, otherwise you pick the appropriate step again.

Please print out the sequence of numbers that lead to 1, starting with n, and how many times (in sumation) the above two commands are run.

n = input number
counter=0 /*the value that keeps track of how many times number runs through the loop*/

for(int i=0, n!=1 /*(this is tested before loop is executed)*/, i++){
	if (n%2==0){
		w=n/2        //can be n=n/2
		Print w
		count= counter +1
		counter=count
		n=w
	}
	else { // (n%2!=0)
		x=3*n
		y=x+1
		coUnt= counter +1
		counter=coUnt
		Print y
		n=y
	}
}
Print n
Print "The number of times ran throught"+counter
